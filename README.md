Hey!

So this will be my portfolio for now where I'll be showcasing my projects as well as previous experience. I chose React as my framework of choice for this project. 
I love playing around with colors, and I found that the yellow goes awesome with the "watery" background video. I wanted to keep it modern and minimalistic. 

If you enjoy the design or have any input feel free to hit me up!
